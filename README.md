# Philosophy of Science Interactive Tools

Welcome to the repository for Philosophy of Science simulations.
Click the links below to run the tools directly in your browser:

### 1. Causal Detectives (Isager 2023)
This tool explores directionality, confounding variables, and selection bias.
👉 **[Click here to run the Isager Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/Isager_2023.html)**

### 2. Survivorship Bias (The Missing Bullet Holes)
This tool visualizes why we often misinterpret success by ignoring failure (Abraham Wald's WWII aircraft analysis).
👉 **[Click here to run the Survivorship Bias Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/survivorship_bias.html)**

### 3. Randomization & Sample Size
This simulation demonstrates why randomization alone isn't enough. It shows how small sample sizes fail to create "equal groups" (baseline equivalence) and why larger samples are necessary to trust experimental results.
👉 **[Click here to run the Randomization Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/randomization_sample_size.html)**

### 4. Statistical Control Intuition <br>
This tool visualizes how "controlling for a variable" works visually. It demonstrates how accounting for a confounder (like temperature) can reveal the true relationship between two variables (like ice cream sales and shark attacks).
👉 **[Click here to run the Statistical Control Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/statistical_control_intuition.html)**

### 5. The "Dice" Challenge (Effect vs. Sample Size)
This simulation challenges you to find a "hidden effect." It demonstrates that finding a significant result depends heavily on having a powerful enough "microscope" (Sample Size) relative to the size of the effect you are looking for.
👉 **[Click here to run the Effect Size Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/effect_sample_size.html)**

### 6. Closed vs. Open Approach
This tool illustrates the distinction between the 'Closed' (Deductive) and 'Open' (Inductive) approach. It compares making a specific bet beforehand versus looking for noteworthy patterns in the data after the fact.
👉 **[Click here to run the Closed vs. Open Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/open_closed_approach.html)**

### 7. GenAI Knowledge Landscape Analogy
This tool visualizes the "knowledge landscape" analogy to explore how Generative AI navigates, connects, and structures information.
👉 **[Click here to run the GenAI Landscape Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/GenAI_knowledge_landscape_analogy.html)**
