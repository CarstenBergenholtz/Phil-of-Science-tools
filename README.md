# Philosophy of Science Interactive Tools

Welcome to the repository for Philosophy of Science simulations.

### 1. Causal Detectives (Isager 2023)
This tool explores directionality, confounding variables, and selection bias.
👉 **[Click here to run the Isager Simulator](https://carstenbergenholtz.github.io/Phil-of-Science-tools/Isager_2023.html)**

### 2. Survivorship Bias (The Missing Bullet Holes)
This tool visualizes why we often misinterpret success by ignoring failure (Abraham Wald's WWII aircraft analysis).

### 3. Randomization & Sample Size
This simulation demonstrates why randomization alone isn't enough. It shows how small sample sizes fail to create "equal groups" (baseline equivalence) and why larger samples are necessary to trust experimental results.
